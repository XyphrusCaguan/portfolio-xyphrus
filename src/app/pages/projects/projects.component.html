                During the span of my On-The-Job training program in Spring Valley company, I have participated in developing a complex project that has its main target of users to the companies, schools and students nationwide.

                During my Thesis Writing in college we developed a chatbot that aims to  aid mental health professionals in dealing with their patients because of the increased rate of mental health related cases during the pandemic and named it as Syrene. I was assigned as a backend developer and we used Python Flask as our framework and Python as the programming language for the chatbot system and algorithm.
